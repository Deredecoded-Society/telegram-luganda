Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on GitHub, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests, and most importantly a good stepping stone to improving Luganda in technology. It gives the Ugandan people and many African's as a result a chance to participate in rebuilding the great continent's technology.
